dynamic library(.so) : It helps in dynamic linking i.e,. dynamic load time linking and dynamic run time linking.
		       Another name of dynamic library is "shared object" or "DLL files" in windows, so the 
		       extension is .so in linux and .dll(Dynamic Link Library) in windows.
		       When the linker is dynamically linking with dynamic libraries, required function definitions			     are not copied to executable file. Thus executable file size is less.
