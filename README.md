<td> Data Structure & Algorithm (DSA) </td>

<td> GNU Compiler Collections (GCC) </td>
<td> The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called gcc, or machine-gcc when cross-compiling, or machine-gcc-version to run a specific version of GCC.  When you compile C++ programs, you should invoke GCC as g++ instead </td>
