# Message Queue

A message queue is a linked list of messages stored within the kernel and identified by a message queue identifier.
A new queue is created or an existing queue opened by msgget(). 

New messages are added to the end of a queue by msgsnd(). Every message has a positive long integer type field, a
non-negative length, and the actual data bytes (corresponding to the length), all of which are specified to msgsnd()
when the message is added to a queue. Messages are fetched from a queue by msgrcv(). We donâ€™t have to fetch the
messages in a first-in, first-out order. Instead, we can fetch messages based on their type field.

All processes can exchange information through access to a common system message queue. The sending process places a
message (via some (OS) message-passing module) onto a queue which can be read by another process. Each message is
given an identification or type so that processes can select the appropriate message. Process must share a common key
in order to gain access to the queue in the first place.

<b><i> System calls used for message queue </i></b>
```
ftok()   : is use to generate key.

msgget() : either returns the message queue identifier for a newly created message queue or returns the
		identifiers for a queue which exists with same key value.

msgsnd() : Data is placed on to a message queue by calling msgsnd().

msgrcv() : messages are retrieved from a queue.

msgctl() : It performs various operations on a queue. Generally it is use to destroy message queue.
