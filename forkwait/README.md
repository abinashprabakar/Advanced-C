1. wait_example

In this program, the working of wait() function call is explained. If fork becomes zero, the child process in terminated
wait(NULL) will block parent process until any of its children has finished. 


2. wait_example2

This is another example of wait(), initially fork() > 0, so first "Hello from parent" is printed and fork() becomes
zero and "Hello from child" is printed. wait(NULL) will block parent process until any of its children has finished. 
If child terminates before parent process reaches wait(NULL) then the child process turns to a zombie process until its parent waits on it and its released from memory. 


3. wait_macros

This program shows some of the macros of wait functions such as WIFEXITED, WTERMSIG, WEXITSTATUS, WIFSIGNALED etc.
 **WIFEXITED(wstatus)**   - child exited normally.
 **WEXITSTATUS(wstatus)** - return code when child exits.
 **WIGSIGNALED(status)**  - child exited because a signal was not caught.
 **WTERMSIG(status)**     - gives the number of the terminating signal.
 **WIFSTOPPED(status)**   - child is stopped.
 **WSTOPSIG(status)**     - gives the number of the stop signal.
