		A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

		Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another 
		link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. 
		Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.

			Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

			Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

			LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

		[Note :  Item navigation is forward only in single linked list.]

		A group of nodes which are linked together with 2 links is called Double linked list. Double linked 
		list is a linear data structure which is capable to traverse in forward direction as well as backward
		direction. Every node in double linked list contains three parts ;
			1. Information   2. Address of next node  3. Address of previous node	
		The last node of double linked list *next should be NULL indicating end of the linked list.
		The first node of double linked list *prev should be NULL indicating start of linked list
