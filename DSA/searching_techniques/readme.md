**hash_table.c** - <a href = "">code</a>

		Hashing is an efficient method to store and retrieve elements.

		Itâ€™s exactly same as index page of a book. In index page, every topic is associated with a page number. 		If we want to look some topic, we can directly get the page number from the index.

		Likewise, in hashing every value will be associated with a key. Using this key, we can point out 
		the element directly.
