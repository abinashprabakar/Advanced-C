1) What is your numerical user id(uid)? Note: Each user has a numeric UID associated with them. Unix does not really
care about the username, but does care about UID. Take a look at the passwd and group files as well as the id command.

		Soln : id (or) id -u username	|	sudo cat /etc/passwd


2) What is your numerical group id?

		Soln : id (or) id -g username

5) What are the permissions of the Linux group file, in the numeric octal representation?

		Soln : chmod 775 filename


6) What is the filesystem path of the Linux group file? Hint: Check man group.

		Soln : The /etc/group file is a text file that defines the groups on the system.  
			There is one entry per line, with the following format:

        			   group_name:password:GID:user_list

       		The fields are as follows:

       			group_name  the name of the group.

       			password    the (encrypted) group password.  If this field is empty, no password is needed.

       			GID         the numeric group ID.

      		 	user_list   a list of the usernames that are members of this group, separated by commas.
