**GCC**

		GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collections which is used to compile mainly C and C++ language. 
		It can also be used to compile Objective C and Objective C++. The most important option required 
		while compiling a source code file is the name of the source program, rest every argument is optional 
		like a warning, debugging, linking libraries, object file etc.

		The different stages of gcc command allows the user to stop the compilation process at different stages.
				
			1. Preprocessing stage [ Removal of comments, Expansion of macros, etc,. ] -> filename.i
			2. Compiling stage [ produce intermediate compiled output file ] -> filename.s
			3. Assembly stage [ existing code is converted into machine language ] -> filename.o
			4. Linker stage [all the linking of function are done ] -> filename


**GCC Options**

		When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking.  
		The "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the 
		-c option says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output by 
		the assembler.


				-c  -S  -E  -o file  -x language -v  -###
           			--help[=class[,...]]  --target-help  --version
           			-pass-exit-codes  -pipe  -specs=file  -wrapper @file
           			-ffile-prefix-map=old=new -fplugin=file
           			-fplugin-arg-name=arg -fdump-ada-spec[-slim]
           			-fada-spec-parent=unit  -fdump-go-spec=file

		
1. -D name
```
			Predefine name as macro, with definition 1.

		Eg : 
		     #include<stdio.h>
		     int main()
		     {
			printf("Value : %d",CONST);
			return 0;
		     }		 
```
